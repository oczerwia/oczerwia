- 👋 Hi, my Name is Oliver Czerwiak and I am currently studying Information Systems Management at the Berlin Institute of Technology (TU Berlin).
- 👀 I’m interested in fitness, music (especially rock/metal, oldschool hiphop and techno) and all things about data and autonomous vehicles.
- 🌱 Currently I am using this profile to collaborate with a collegue. We are writing our own autonomous toy vehicle!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on WebScrapers and on Data Analysis. Hit me up if you have an interesting dataset that you want to explore.
